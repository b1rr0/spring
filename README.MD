## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

## Start PostgreSQL
Use Docker Compose to bring up the PostgreSQL service:
docker-compose up

# Run the Application
 Unfortunately, the application itself isn't dockerized yet, so you'll need to run it manually.

# Access the API
Once the application is running, you can interact with it using Swagger UI at:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/



## Running Tests
All tests are located in the test folder.
You can run them to ensure everything is working as expected.
